Patrick is a staff field engineer at Grafana Labs.

He is always trying to keep up with best practices for cloud native infrastructure and enjoys helping others learn the same. When he's not busy tinkering with Kubernetes, he's probably building something in his garage, trying to find the best pizza recipe, or stepping on snacks dropped by his kids.
